<H1>Upgrading from Cyrus SASLv1 to Cyrus SASLv2</H1>

This document covers issues with upgrading from SASLv1 to SASLv2.
To upgrade:

<ol>
<li> Install Cyrus SASLv2 as normal according to <a
href="install.html">the installation guide</a>.  This will overwrite
some manpages, but will not affect your current applications.  Do NOT
attempt to make it use the same directories.</li>

<li> If you are using <tt>/etc/sasldb</tt> for any authentication, run
<tt>utils/dbconverter-2</tt> after installation.</li>

<li> If you are continuing to use libsaslv1 applications, read onwards
to understand the ramifications.</li>

<li> If you want to learn how to port applications from SASLv1 to SASLv2,
you should read <A HREF=appconvert.html>this document</A>.
</ol>

<h2><A NAME="overview">Backwards Compatibility</A></h2>

Cyrus SASLv2 is completely incompatible with applications that use
Cyrus SASLv1.  This means that applications are unable to
simultaneously link both versions of the library, and developers are
encouraged to instead develop or upgrade their applications to link
against the new libsasl.<p>

Likewise, the format for the sasldb database has been completely
revamped.  See <A HREF="#db">here</A> for a discussion of the relevant
upgrade issues related to sasldb.  All new passwords stored in the
sasldb database will be in plaintext, meaning that a compromised
sasldb will compromise all services with the same passwords.  (This
situation isn't significantly worse, cryptographicly speaking, than
the old method and allows the database to be easy to transition to
another format, when the need arises.)  Mechanisms requiring a more
secure password database backend (e.g. SRP) should implement their own
or use alternate property names within sasldb.<P>

<h2><A NAME="coexist">Coexistence with SASLv1</A></h2>

The two library versions and the associated utilities should be able
to coexist on the same system.  The man pages will be unable to
coexist (but luckily the new manpages are much better!).  The libsasl
v2-specific utilities have had a "2" appended to their name for this
purpose (e.g. <tt>saslpasswd2</tt>, <tt>sasldblistusers2</tt>).  The
new-style sasldb now defaults to the name <tt>/etc/sasldb2</tt>, but
this is configurable.

<h2><A NAME="db">Database Upgrades</A></h2>

While there does not seem to be any conflict with the keys stored in
the database, it is not recommended for both versions of the library
to use the same database file.  Included in the utils directory is a
program called <tt>dbconverter-2</tt> which will allow you to convert
from the old-format database to the new format.  If you continue to
run applications that rely on Cyrus SASLv2 the databases will not be
kept in sync by any automatic means.<p>
