<H1>Installation Procedure</H1>

This document offers a general overview of installing the SASL library.

<H2>Quick and Dirty</H2>
<pre>
  cd (directory it was untarred into)
  ./configure
  make
  make install
</pre>

If you're checking this directly out of CVS, you'll need to run "sh
./SMakefile" to build the configure script first.<p>

<A HREF=sysadmin.html>Read</A> to learn how to configure SASL.  There is
also a <A HREF=upgrading.html>document</A> that covers upgrade issues.

<H2>Details</H2>

Note that the library looks for plugins in <tt>/usr/lib/sasl2</tt>,
but installs them into <tt>${prefix}/lib/sasl2</tt>, where
<tt>${prefix}</tt> is usually something like <tt>/usr/local</tt>.
This is intentional - we want the plugins installed with the rest of
the package (wherever things get installed at your site), but we want
the library to *always* be able to find its plugins under
<tt>/usr/lib/sasl2</tt>, no matter where you install things, so that
the SASL plugin ABI on all platforms is roughly the same.<p>

If you don't want to do this for some reason, you can set the location
where the library will look for plugins by setting the environment
variable SASL_PATH to the path the library should use.<p>

You'll probably need the GNU make program, available as of this
writing <a
href=ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/make-3.77.tar.gz>here</a>.<p>

libsasl2 can use gdbm, Berkeley db, or ndbm to implement its
user/password lookup. Most systems come with ndbm these days; as of
this writing, gdbm is available as <a
href=ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gdbm/gdbm-1.7.3.tar.gz>this file</a>.
Berkeley DB is available from: <a
href=http://www.sleepycat.com/>here</a><p>

For Kerberos support, you'll need the kerberos libraries.  At CMU, the
version we use comes from <a href=http://www.pdc.kth.se/kth-krb/>here</a>.<p>

For GSSAPI support you will need either MIT Kerberos 5 or the
<a href=http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal>Heimdal implementation</a>.<p>

For OTP support you will need
<a href=http://www.inner.net/~cmetz/opie>OPIE v2.4</a> and <a
href=../contrib/opie-2.4-fixes>this patch</a>.<p>

This has been tested under Linux 2.2, Linux 2.4, Solaris 2.7 and Solaris 2.8.
It should work under any platform where dynamic objects can be linked against
other dynamic objects, and where the dynamic library file extension is
".so", or where libtool creates the .la files correctly.<p>

You may want to play with your CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS a little if you're
using vendor compilers (which we recommend).  You can see what
compilers we use on our platforms by looking at the "SMakefile".

<h2>Installation under Win32:</h2>

<B>If you are using SASL under Win32 or have compiled it, please let
us know!</B>
<br>
<i>Note: The Win32 port of SASLv2 is Incomplete.</i><p>

We've tested the latest version under Windows and are eager to see
other people use it!<p>

<ul>
<li>From within Visual C++, open workspace "sasl\win32\libsasl\libsasl.dsw"
<li>Select "Batch Build" under the Build menu to build all versions.
</ul>

At this time, there are no installers available.  To install by hand:

<ul>
<li>Decide on an installation directory for your plugins (IE: c:\windows\sasl)
<li>Copy all generated plugins into this directory:
<pre>
  cd sasl\win32
  copy libsasl\Release\*.dll c:\sasl-plugins
  copy saslANONYMOUS\Release\*.dll c:\sasl-plugins 
  copy saslCRAM\Release\*.dll c:\sasl-plugins
  copy saslKERBEROSV4\Release\*.dll c:\sasl-plugins
  copy saslPLAIN\Release\*.dll c:\sasl-plugins
</pre>
<li>Update the registry with these locations.  Example registry settings
    are in the file:
<pre>
  sasl\win32\cmu-sasl.reg
</pre>
<li>Add this directory to your path, so that apps will be able to find  
    the library
<pre>
  PATH=c:\sasl-plugins;%PATH%
</pre>
</ul>

This has been tested under Windows 2000, using Visual Studio 6 SP1.   

<H3>More notes</H3>

<ul>
<li>ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5 and KERBEROS_V4 have been tested.
<li>Kerberos mechanism has been compiled using MIT's kclient package
<li>PLAIN is currently crippled, and does not support server use.
<li>GSSAPI has been totally untested.
</ul>
